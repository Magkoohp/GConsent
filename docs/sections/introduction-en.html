<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
<a href="#european_parliament_and_council_regulation_2016">[1]</a> is the current
European data protection law enforced from 25<sup>th</sup> May 2018. It affects
any service or organisation that uses personal data, and has large fines
to deter non-compliance. Consent is one of the legal basis for using
personal data under the GDPR (Art.6). Consent is considered valid only
when it is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous (Art.2-11);
and in the case of minors to be given by their legal guardian (Art.8).
GDPR also provides rights regarding changing and withdrawing consent at
any time. To demonstrate compliance with these obligations, Data
Controllers should maintain a demonstrable proof of the given consent
<a href="#tikkinen-piri_eu_2018">[2]</a> by collecting and storing information on how
consent was collected, used, and invalidated <a href="#mittal_role_2017">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Semantic Web technologies are ideal for representing this information
because of its flexibility in expressing concepts and relationships,
e.g. using the Web Ontology Language - OWL2, using a standardised model
for data - i.e. the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Existing work
<a href="#bartolini_reconciling_2015">[4]</a>, <a href="#fatema_compliance_2017">[5]</a>, <a href="#pandit_modelling_2017">[6]</a>, <a href="#pandit_gdprtext_2018">[7]</a>, <a href="#belhajjame_provenance_2018">[8]</a>, <a href="#palmirani_pronto:_2018">[9]</a>, <a href="#bonatti_special_2018">[10]</a>, <a href="#kirrane_scalable_2018">[11]</a> 
has demonstrated the feasibility of using semantic web technologies for
representing and querying metadata for assisting with the GDPR
compliance process. Our previous work presented the Consent and Data
Management Model (CDMM) <a href="#fatema_compliance_2017">[5]</a> as a framework for
information related to GDPR and its compliance using semantic web
technologies, which included a preliminary OWL2 ontology for
representing consent.</p>
<p>Through this documentation, we present the GConsent OWL2 ontology for representing
consent based on the preliminary ontology part of CDMM
<a href="#fatema_compliance_2017">[5]</a>. The documentation also presents a discussion of the
GConsentâ€™s modelling of concepts and relationships for demonstrating
compliance to the various obligations stipulated by the GDPR regarding
consent. </p>
