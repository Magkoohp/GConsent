The creation of the ontology followed an iterative model consisting of the following steps:

1. Gather information from GDPR, articles, academic papers, communications from various supervisory bodies and regulatory authorities (such as the Data Protection Commissioner's office)
2. Quantify information as a set of requirements
3. Create models for representation of information
4. Test the model using-
	- Various use-cases for expressibility
	- Competency Questions for effectiveness
	- OntoClean for completeness
	- SPARQL queries for usability
5. Generate OWL2 ontology for the model
6. Ensure ontology quality using best practices and guidelines

PrOnto <a href="#ref-pronto">[ref]</a> describes the Methodology for building Legal Ontology (MeLOn), which is a 10 step process geared towards involving legal experts in the ontology building process. GConsent plans to integrate this methodology to further expand the ontology to other areas of legal compliance. Noted below are the steps or objectives common between methodologies used by PrOnto and GConsent from the MeLOn list:

* Start with the aim/goal.
* Identify parameters for evaluation. For GConsent, these were - coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, usability, and extendability.
* State of the art survey.
* Use of Graffoo.
* Use of OntoClean to improve the ontology.
* Use of SPARQL to test applicability.

		<li><p>Article 4 (11) GDPR requires that consent
be given by a freely given, informed and unambigu

processing of his or her personal data. In order to be
informed, the consent must also comprise the pur
pose of the data processing. Consent must be explic

or that data are processed for profiling purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>The GDRP explicitly prescribes that data subjects be
able to withdraw their consent at any time [Article 7

<div id="div-competency-questions">
	<h3 id="comptency-questions" class="list">Competency Questions</h3>
	<p>The ontology is validated using the following competency questions. These questions are based on the various requirements of consent as specified under GDPR, as well as to explore the role of various entities and agents in the state of consent. The questions are also useful to validate the data instances created using the ontology.</p>

<div id="div-ontology-quality">
	<h3 id="ontology-quality" class="list">Ensuring Ontology Quality</h3>
	<p>The ontology follows best practices guidelines encouraged and adopted by the semantic web community. The list below lists these, along with a few comments.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-vocab-pub/">Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies - W3C Working Group Note 28 August 2008</a><br/>
		These guidelines form the core of best practices, and relate to creation and usage of namespaces and content negotiation. GConsent uses a consistent naming convention based on these guidelines, and provides content negotiation in the serialisation formats listed at the top of this documentation.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.essepuntato.it/lode">Live OWL Documentation Environment (LODE)</a><br/>
		LODE is a well-known service within the semantic web community for self-documentation of ontologies. GConsent provides relevant metadata to document the ontology in a LODE-compatible manner.</li>
		<li><a href="http://oops.linkeddata.es/">OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner!</a><br/>
		OOPS! is another well-known service that detects some of the most common pitfalls appearing when developing ontologies. GConsent was tested iteratively throughout its development using the OOPS! service. Note: the latest version of GConsent shows some pitfalls in the OOPS! report, which result from its usage of external concepts and properties (mostly from PROV-0). The pitfalls can be safely discarded as there are no errors directly related to the concepts and relationships definde within GConsent.</li>
		<li><a href="https://dgarijo.github.io/Widoco/">WIzard for DOCumenting Ontologies (WIDOCO)</a><br/>
		WIDOCO extends the LODE and OOPS! services along with Licensius, WebVOWL, and Bubastis to create a set of documentation based on best practices and guidelines, that can be edited and served in a responsible manner using pre-configured files for Apache. GConsent uses WIDOCO to generate the documentation pages, and follows its set of best practices - <a href="https://dgarijo.github.io/Widoco/doc/bestPractices/index-en.html">A checklist for complete vocabulary metadata - 25 April 2017</a>.</li>
